# file_compare

<p> This is a simple script that compares two folder structures for differences. The rightside will be compared to the leftside and anything missing from the rightside will be output to "differences.txt".<br>
</p>

<p> At this time, there isn't anything that checks if the rightside has extra files.
</p>

### When inputing your directories, ensure you end the folder path with a "\\" on windows or "/" if you are on macOS/Linux
#### Notice in these examples all end with "\\": <br> C:\folder\ <br> F:\ <br> F:\folder\
